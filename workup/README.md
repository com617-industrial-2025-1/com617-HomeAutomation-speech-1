# VLM Module - PI - Bob Potter - telemetry solutions

Hi Craig,

I've been monitoring the Hailo GIT pages and on Tuesday they dropped a significant upgrade that included a VLM model. 
It required a kernel upgrade and the latest version 64 bit Trixie OS and no small amount of fiddling about but it did eventually spring into life.
Probably too late for the guys in your project group but I put it through its paces this morning to see how good the AI is on a total edge device.

Model : https://hailo.ai/products/hailo-software/model-explorer/generative-ai/qwen2-vl-2b/ 

The set up:
A camera looking at a slide show on an Amazon Echo.
I'm reasonably impressed by the richness of the responses and could be something that, if packaged, could help the DIY SOS family. 
The python program would need tweaking to send the text to a suitable device that is able to display the vision readout.


See [VLM_examples.pdf](../workup/VLM_examples-2.pdf)

## installation

This is a step by step guide but should be used with care as it may depend on the version of the Kernel and OS running on the pi5.
